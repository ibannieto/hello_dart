# hello_dart

I'm learning both [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic) and Dart/Flutter, so I build a wee application for Learn Scottish Gaelic using the [main website](https://www.learngaelic.net/) as inspiration.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
